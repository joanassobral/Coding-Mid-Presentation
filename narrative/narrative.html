    <p>I’ve been finding it difficult to enter the complex world of this book and finding a voice in it.
        What do I want to say about this book? is a question I’ve been asked multiple times throughout this last block, and I’m just now starting to really get it.</p>
    
    <p>Because of this I’ve had a very strong tendency to be extremely respectful of the content, (also because that’s how my chosen book seems to treat it), and somewhat afraid to make more editorial, expressive choices. This could become a discussion about a designer’s “responsibility” of truthful representation. But I want to make sure I remember that truthfully representing something can mean many different things.</p>

    <p>These are some of my first experiments:</p>

    <p>Now, I understand that what I’ll want to say about this book will come from my own idea of its truth. Returning to the very first text I wrote in the beginning of this project, these words sound like a way forward in my process:</p>

    <p id="lastItem">“This book pays great respect to these children, taking very seriously their fantastical words and dreams of playing football professionally. Yet, without titles, page numbers, or a prominent grid, this book builds suspense with each turn of the page, and I’m not able to shake the feeling that a distinctly complex maturity lies behind the stories told by this book.”</p>
